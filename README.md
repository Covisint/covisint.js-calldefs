## Installing
+ npm install
+ etc...

## Using
+ Either copy the defs into App.
+ Or reference the obj directly from node_modules/@covisint...
    * but then how does a build package them for you?
+ Load them via your covisintJs.create({defs: [[{...}]]}).
+ Make sure your final built App has the defs!
